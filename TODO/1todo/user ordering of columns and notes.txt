allow user ordering of notes and columns
======================================

rationale: 

What if I want to compare two notes by having them adjacent to one another?
What if I want to rearrange the columns temporarily, for my current workflow?

I've gone back and forth on this a few times,
and for a long time the decision was to NOT allow user-ordering.

But for me, the above rationales trump the complexity that omitting this would save.
