open note in system-specific text editor

hidden in a context menu;
might want to provide a means of discovering this functionality

this was actually redesigned after testing on linux;
worked fine on mac, but not linux.
Turns out there is no standard linux-specific command 
to open in the system-default editor

let alone (god forbid) a Java(/FX) platform agnostic method to do it
