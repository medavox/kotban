match the height of the TextArea to the amount of space needed to display its text,

including (the hard part) taking into account line wrapping

Side-issue: incontrovertibly prevent the TextArea's own scrollbars from showing up

related to (fix) vertical scrollbars on columns that aren't tall enough to need them,
but which disappear after a refresh
(fix) very long notes still have scrollbars,
  cause scrollbars to appear on other notes in the same column


this took A LOT of work to fix,
and caused me to take a break from dev for a while.

Ended up with me forking TextArea, so I could get at private variables
that provided the behaviour I needed,

this was AFTER I spent a couple of weeks essentially trying to
 reverse-engineer JavaFX's text-wrapping algorithm,
which turns out to be implemented externally in some weird possibly native module
named Prism or Quantum.
